# Mesh Contracts

Contract-first artifacts for all microservices:
- `proto`: internal gRPC contracts
- `openapi`: external REST contracts
- `events`: event envelopes and schemas
- `schemas`: shared payload schemas

All contract changes must preserve backward compatibility unless versioned explicitly.
